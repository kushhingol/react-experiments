    <!--The div where the entire react application will be mounted, we can consider this as root of the application-->
    <!-- To keep it simple its like the entry point where the react app is rendered or injected-->
    <div id="root">
      <!-- As you can see the below h1 tag is very mad at react because when react runs the render on the root,
        it will replace all the stuff present inside the HTML and will replace it will the root component passed in the render, (See an example in App.js)-->
      <h1>
        Hello React, I am very mad at you because you will replace me once you
        render the app in the root
      </h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Just an experiment to mount another react application in the different root element-->
    <div id="root2"></div>

    <!-- The fun starts below -->
    <!-- This is an example of react cdn where we can directly use react in a vanilla format without depending on npm or create react app package-->
    <!-- Since react is a JS library this becomes feasibly to use it as a JS method or APIs provided by react-->
    <!-- We need both react and react dom because react dom is responsible to manage the DOM operations for react, like render method and any other DOM manipulation operation-->

    <!-- Production suggestion-->
    <!-- Note: This is not a recommended way to use react in production for large web application -->
    <!--       This can be useful in a micro-frontend architecture to develop a very small application with react capability-->

    <!-- What the heck is crossorigin ðŸ¤” -->
    <!-- Crossorigin is nothing but an attribute of script tag which provides CORS policy to get the third party libraries from external resources-->
    <!-- It provides a trust to the HTTP request that the source can be trusted and adds permission to fetch the data during HTTP handshake-->
